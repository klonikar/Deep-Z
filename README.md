# Deep-Z: Three-dimensional propagation and time-reversal of fluorescence images 
Neural network learns fluorescence wave propagation and time-reversal to propagate a 2D fluorescence image onto user-defined 3D surfaces, enabling 3D imaging of fluorescent samples using a single 2D image, without mechanical scanning, additional hardware, or a trade-off of resolution or speed. For details, refer to our publication "Three-dimensional propagation and time-reversal of fluorescence images" [1].  (Video below: Deep-Z reconstruction of a C. elegans using Deep-Z inference)
